    <h1>Curriculum Vitae</h1>
    <h2>Shinei Nouzen</h2>
    <h3>Profile</h3>
    <p>His personal name is Undertaker. He is the leader of the Spearhead Squadron, as well as the default operations
        commander of the Eighty-Sixth Strike Package. Among the Eighty-Six, he is known as the Reaper of the Eastern
        Front. His ability to hear the voices of the Legion designated him as a high-priority target with the callsign
        of BÃ¡leygr. </p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Name: Shinei Nouzen (Shin)</li>
        <li>Date of Birth: May 19th RY 351/SY 2132 </li>
        <li>Place of Birth: Republic of San Magnolia</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Reputation</h3>
    <p>Shin is known as the Reaper of the Eastern front, a practical legend among the Eighty-Six. Both a moniker of
        reverence and fear, those who were assigned in the same squadron as him dreaded their fate of certain demise, or
        accepted that they would die knowing Shin would carry on their memory. No one would survive long term in a
        squadron with Shin present, no one except the one known as Wehrwolf. Shin is often compared to a plague bringer
        or a prophet of death. </p>
    <h3>Abilities</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Telepathy: A genetic feature that is seen in people of Pyrope heritage, specifically the Maika Clan. Those
            with the
            extrasensory ability can communicate with family members by hearing their thoughts. The ability allows Shin
            to detect the Legion because the Legion was designed with the human neural system as a basis for their
            central processing system.</li>
        <li>Intelligence: Due to his habit of reading as a pastime, Shin has accumulated a great deal of knowledge in
            various fields, including obscure and old concepts like the salic law. Shin has a good grasp of military
            tactics and strategies, despite never receiving any formal training or education. </li>
        <li>Combat Skill: Even during his first sorties with only one month of training, Shin's maneuvers, judgment, and
            decision-making were well above what was expected of him. Although he had never experienced combat before,
            his instincts as an Onyx immediately kicked in, granting him a precise awareness of the battlefield. </li>
    </ol>
